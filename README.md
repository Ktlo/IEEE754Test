# IEEE 754 Test
This is the program that helped me to write my course work.
There are no interesting thing. But you can use it to see yourself
every special situatuations in IEEE 754 floating point number with single precision.
## Usage
Program reads two bit masks from input stream. The first bit mask is for significant part and the second is for the exponent.
The result writes to the output stream. This is a plain text
which consists of the values for input numbers (A and B) and output number (Y) for each test.
## Tests
There are 22 tests shows different results in IEEE 754 format number.
